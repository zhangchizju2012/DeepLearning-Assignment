generate(model, variables file, seed string, length),

In my function, model is a list of models as defined in the previous scripts (so you can pass several models to generate sentences.), variables file is a path to a file that contains saved values for the variables in the model from some previous training run, seed string is a string used to start the sequential sampling, and length is the number of characters to produce in sequence, including the seed string. The function will print all sentences generated by different models in the terminal directly.

You can run the program directly, cause I didn't delete two saved models, which is saved at:
experiments2/3_losses/out/3b_loss/3b_loss
experiments2/2_gates/out/2c_gate/2c_gate
